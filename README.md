# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Naomi Wanjiru

**Data Analyst | Python, SQL, Excel | Financial Inclusion & Agricultural Systems**

I help organizations make sense of data by combining strong analytical skills with domain expertise in **agriculture, finance and emerging markets**.  
My focus is on turning raw datasets into **insights that guide real decisions** , whether thatâ€™s identifying growth patterns, modeling financial risk or building dashboards that reveal hidden trends.  


## About Me  
Iâ€™m a **Data Analyst with a background in Economics & Statistics**.  

- I explored **mobile money trends** in Kenya, uncovering growth, seasonality and transaction patterns from CBK data.  
- I built a **loan default prediction model** in Python using classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM), applying machine learning to real-world credit risk.
- I am currently building an **agritech startup**, analyzing poultry farming economics, input costs and contract-farming models.  
- I am passionate about using data to design **inclusive solutions** in finance and agriculture, where analytics can unlock opportunities for smallholder farmers and underserved markets.  

What sets me apart is blending **statistical reasoning** with **business context** , not just *what the data shows*, but *why it matters*.  


## Skills & Tools  

**Data Analysis & Programming**  
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)  
- SQL (data extraction, joins, aggregations, queries)  
- Excel (Pivot Tables, Dashboards, business analysis)  

**Visualization & Reporting**  
- Excel Dashboards  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Markdown & GitHub for documentation   

**Statistical & Analytical Methods**  
- Regression analysis, classification models  
- Forecasting & time series trends  
- Growth & seasonality analysis  
- Financial & economic modeling  

**Domain Focus**  
- Mobile money & digital finance  
- Agritech & agricultural value chains  
- Risk modeling & credit scoring  


## ðŸ“‚ Featured Projects  

### [Mobile Money Trends in Kenya (CBK Data)](https://github.com/N-Shelmith/Mobile_Payments_Analysis.git)  
- Analyzed **mobile payments growth, seasonality and transaction efficiency** using CBK official statistics (2007â€“2024).  
- Built an interactive **Excel dashboard** with KPIs, pivot tables, slicers and charts.  
- Key insights:  
  - December consistently records the **highest transaction value** (holiday effect).  
  - Transaction values dipped in **2019** and **2022**, reflecting possible macroeconomic shocks.  
  - Agents grew slower than accounts, suggesting **network strain** over time.  


### [Loan Default Prediction (Python, ML)]()  
- Built a **classification model** to predict loan defaults using financial and demographic variables.  
- Conducted **data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and model evaluation** (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM).  
- Evaluated performance with **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC**.  
- Key insights:  
  - Credit history and income were the strongest predictors of default.  
  - Logistic Regression provided the most balanced trade-off between accuracy and interpretability.
